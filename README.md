THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under  
WHEN I enter my GitHub username  
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile
WHEN I enter my email address

## Getting Started
Here are some guidelines to help you get started:  

Create a .gitignore file and include node_modules/ and .DS_Store/ so that your node_modules directory isn't tracked or uploaded to GitHub. Be sure to create your .gitignore file before installing any npm dependencies.  

Make sure that your repo includes a package.json with the required dependencies. You can create one by running npm init when you first set up the project, before installing any dependencies.  

Include a video of the typical user flow through your application. This includes views of the prompts and the responses after their selection.  

Include any other screenshots you deem necessary to help someone who has never been introduced to your application understand the purpose and function of it. This is how you will communicate to potential employers or other developers in the future what you built and why, and to show how it works.
